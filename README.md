## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Athanasios Tsanas and Max little from University of Oxford created this data by working in unison with ten different medical centers in the US and Intel. The data consists of biomedical data from different Parkinson’s disease patients equipped with monitoring devices, storing information such as age, gender and UPDRS (Parkinson’s scale) progression. The data was collected over a six-month period, back in 2009. It allows the monitoring of Parkinson’s development through telemonitoring devices, allowing comparisons between age, accuracy, and other statistics in order to draw up conclusions such as average development time for early onset Parkinson’s, or how effective/accurate the recorded data may be. It was taken from 42 individual patients, with  the use of remote telemonitoring devices which stored biomedical voice measurements that help rank the patients Parkinson’s on the UPDRS scale.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The specific data provided could be used to better map trends in the development cycle of Parkinson’s disease, such as age, gender, UPDRS scale correlations and perhaps how accurate the recorded data may prove to be (i.e. how effective are the voice recordings?) It is a topic of great interest because of the medical applications and discoveries one may obtain from it, better mapping trends and observing how the timeline of a disease functions as well as how accurately it may be modeled. A lot of minor data like this that may seem largely insignificant in the grand scheme of the field’s research eventually adds up to something meaningful. The age correlations to the development and worsening of the disease as a trend is the most interesting and upfront answer one can hope to gain from this data. However another line of questioning that could possible be answered with the data and outside research is how effective the telemonitoring devices are at recording the disease progression over the six-month period, as one can imagine such technology is bound to have interference or record faulty data. Finding that margin of error could make for an interesting line of questions. Yes, a user-facing dashboard that presents all the data cleanly as well as interpolating different results so the best parts/conclusion from the data can be drawn by viewers immediately should be possible, but is largely dependent on learning the skills for it.
