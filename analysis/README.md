# Milestone 2 analysis
Our project relies upon finding correlation and possible errors in a data set that contains information about various patients suffering from parkinsons; all of different ages, sex and development. Gathered through remote electronics that take input through their breath, it was to be used in assistance of hospitals and university researches to find additional pieces of data correlation and see what else can be learnt about the elderly's development of the disease.

Our group project revolves around cleaning the data and seeing what correlations or information can be learnt from all this raw input, and see if anything can be mapped. Between the three of us performing different EDA's with different columns of data pitted against each others, we were able to surmize a fair bit of information.

The data itself is quite large, and some columns contain useful details that directly contributed to other columns, but overall detract from the bigger picture. It was important to reduce the load and focus on the areas of data that had the most relevant information in regards to the trends we were searching for. As such, the majority of our exploration focused on relationships between age, time of recordings, UPDRS and jitter variances.

Looking at the age ranges from 36 to 85 of the subjects, one can observe a high amount of cases in those just slightly below 60 years and mid to late 70's. This is a good start that shows the age group where signs and prevalence is most common.

The motor and total UPDRS have a direct positive correlation as expected, showing increasing upward trends over time as the parkinsons develops, thankfully showing little in the way of anomalies in the figures, with just one column being particularly lower than expected in visualizations. This further corroborates that the data and gathering methods work well, as was intended, and solidifies their use while answering our doubts on the matter.

The age correlation in comparison to the scale UPDRS results are promising, except an anomaly worth investigating further crops up in the early 70's age groups. Here it seems to falter significantly in the results then picks itself back onto the normal expected amount in the following age groups of mid 70's to 80's. This could largely be aude to a time difference and development scale that occurs between early parkinsons developments and the expected age group of elderly where it is much more largely expected and recorded.

Overall after parsing through the data, our doubts of accuracy and legitimacy surrounding the recording method of remote breath analysis were put to rest. The data is largely accurate and helpful in further expanding the scientific community's understanding of the disease via increased quantities of data with little human input and supervision. Few anomalies were detected and easily sorted through, and better correlations between age and development of the disease could be established. This is on a short amount of insight however, as a lot of the data can be explored much more in depth, but we stuck to the important parameters in order to get a better overall picture.
